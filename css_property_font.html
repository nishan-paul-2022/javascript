# font is shorthand property for setting :

# font + element
	- px is defined size
	- % is percentage of parent

# font
	- em is multiple of parent-element font-size
	- rem is multiple of root-element font-size

# element
	- vw is viewport width
	- vh is viewport height

- :root should have variables and font properties, cause font is by default defined in root
- * should have box-model properties, cause box-model properties cascade but not impact
- body should have globally applicable styles

[ if we don't specify font size, default size for normal text is 16px (1em) ]
[ responsive design demands rem and vw ] 

# font-pairing :
	- find font pairings that complement each other for harmony.
