				<h2>LOKI : A PERFECT PORTRAYAL OF THE MULTIVERSE SAGA</h2>

				<p>
					God of mischief turns into God of stories, giving us the
					best character arc of the long 15 years of MCU. Neither a
					charismatic villain nor an anti-hero anymore, not even some
					mainstream hero who saves the world and lives happily ever
					after. Rather, he evolves as the savior of the whole
					multiverse, the watcher and the container of all possible
					stories that have ever been written or will be written.
					Finally found his glorious purpose, and yes, none can
					justify this title rather than him. The classic LOKI scene
					is the new definition of goosebumps. If it's not the best,
					surely the second-best iconic moment of the whole MCU.
					Thanks for everything, and kudos to Tom Hiddleston. This
					skinny, tall, long-haired handsome man is surely the biggest
					star in the current franchise. A 10/10 performance that left
					us no choice but to crush on him. LOKI is now more than a
					character, an emotion, isn't he?

					>So, what is LOKI up to this time? What's his glorious
					purpose?

				<hr />

				<p>
					At the very beginning of the MCU, multiple timelines, aka
					multiverse, do exist. In every timeline, for every person,
					there are some nexus events (which we have seen previously
					in Spider-Verse). So, what is a person's nexus event? In a
					nexus event, a new timeline is created for every possible
					choice a person can make. So, for every nexus event, an
					infinite number of timelines are created. In every new
					timeline, for every person, there are also nexus events. So,
					the creation of timelines goes on infinitely. This is fine
					unless some mad-level genius named Kang finds out about it
					and decides to travel across the multiverse. As we have seen
					previously in Doctor Strange, frequent multiversal travel
					causes time incursion, and time incursion causes timeline
					declination. So, an infinite number of Kang variants from an
					infinite number of timelines start a multiversal war against
					each other to save their respective timelines. Because any
					Kang from any timeline is a potential threat to cause time
					incursion to others'. So, a timeline can only survive
					declination if it is the only one that exists. One of the
					Kang variants (he-who-remains) from the sacred timeline made
					TVA in a timeless zone. The core of TVA is a temporal-loop
					that uses cosmic energy to convert the timeline into a
					physical entity called a branch. By using the temporal-loop,
					he-who-remains ensures to destroy every timeline except his
					own, that has ever been created or would be created.
					He-who-remains paves the way for every living entity in his
					timeline to ensure no new timeline can occur. There is a
					high-value cost of doing that: no free will. Anyone can be
					an outcast (or variant) because of his own choice. Every
					time someone does something in a nexus event that goes
					against his predestined decision decided by he-who-remains,
					he will be treated as a variant. When the existence of a
					variant crosses a certain threshold, a new timeline and a
					new branch will be created. This creation will go on and
					increase exponentially. It will cause an overflow in the
					temporal-loop. The temporal-loop will explode and destroy
					TVA. He-who-remains will lose his dominance on the timeline.
					He surely can create another temporal-loop. But multiple
					timelines mean multiple Kang. So in the meantime, again
					another multiversal war will occur. To prevent that from
					happening, a variant needs to be pruned. Pruning means
					sending the variant to the timeless zone where the variant
					can't cause timeline creation. TVA can locate any variant
					from any moment using a tempad, powered by the
					temporal-loop. TVA is in charge of pruning the variant for
					the sake of the integrity of the sacred timeline. But there
					may be a variant who will just refuse to get pruned and
					decide to break the chain. To do that, this variant will
					kill he-who-remains. So that no one will get pruned for
					making his own choice. Now people have free will. Free will
					leads to multiple timelines. Multiple timelines mean
					multiple Kang and new branches on temporal-loop. So
					temporal-loop will overflow, explode, and destroy TVA.
					Without temporal-loop, it will not be possible to stop Kang.
					Kang will find out about the multiverse and start to travel
					across multiverse. This will lead to time incursion and time
					incursion will lead to multiversal war. The loop goes on
					endlessly. It's like replacing one nightmare with another
					one repeatedly for an infinite number of times. Now LOKI is
					up to breaking the loop, saving multiverse, giving people
					free will. That's his glorious purpose.
