<!-- 

    @ DISPLAY 
------------------
        display: inline, block, inline-block, none
        visibility: visible, hidden, collapse

        display: none / hide and remove
        visibility: hidden / hide and not remove
        visibility: collapse / hide and remove

        visibility in table element : we can only use 'collapse' to hide
        visibility in other element : we can only use 'hidden' to hide

        inside inline-element, we can't use block-element
        inside block-element, we can use both block-element and inline-element
        exception: inside paragraph, we can't use block-element

        block-element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
        an inline-element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
        height, width, margin, padding properties are applicable for block and inline-block 

        changing display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, not semantic rules
        so, an inline element with display: block, is not allowed to have block elements inside 


    @ POSITION 
------------------
        position: 
            static      / default-position 
            relative    / in respect of default-position 
            absolute    / in respect of first-positioned-ancestor
            fixed       / in respect of document 
            sticky      / relative and fixed 

        top, bottom, left, right, z-index properties are applicable for positioned-element


------------------
    every property can have initial and inherit value,
        - initial	: sets default value to corrsponding property in element
        - inherit	: inherits value of corrsponding property from parent-element to child-element
