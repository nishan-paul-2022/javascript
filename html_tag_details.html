				<summary>BATMAN</summary>
				<div>
					In my childhood, I can't remember if I gave any special
					attention to Batman. I used to wonder what the significance
					of his being in a team of colossal superheroes was. But
					after watching Chris Nolan's epic Dark Knight trilogy and
					exploring DC animated movies (Gotham Knight, Long Halloween,
					Under The Red Hood, Dark Knight Returns, Mask of The
					Phantasm), I suddenly came to realize what that unstoppable
					impact was that Batman created through his every appearance
					and ideology. Not everyone needs a superpower to become a
					superhero. But it takes unstoppable force and an immovable
					spirit, and it may cost your life or your loved ones. The
					idea is to be a symbol. Batman can be anybody. That is the
					point. You get to learn to hide your anger and practice
					smiling in front of a mirror. It's like wearing a mask.
					Chris Nolan left such a legacy and a benchmark that can be
					delivered once in a lifetime. History may repeat itself. But
					not this one. People will cherish this epic saga for a long
					time, and it will remain a source of massive inspiration
					throughout our day-to-day struggle.
					<hr />
					That everlasting persona Bruce Wayne achieved during his
					reformation in Ra's al Ghul's den teaches the most
					significant motto behind the idea of Batman. People need
					dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy, and Bruce
					Wayne can't do that as a man. As a man, he is flesh and
					blood. He can be ignored, he can be destroyed, but as a
					symbol, he can be incorruptible, he can be everlasting.
					<hr />
					As Alfred taught us, we fall only to rise. That
					unconditional love Batman got from Alfred, even in the
					darkest period of his life, makes us love to think everybody
					deserves an Alfred in their life. There is a moment in
					Justice League Synder Cut when Batman says to his friends,
					"This is Alfred. I work for him." This single line proves
					how loyal these two guys are to each other. Alfred
					influences Batman in every possible way; he motivates,
					guides, and most importantly, serves as the father figure
					that Bruce Wayne desperately needs.
					<hr />
					That intense, breathtaking clash between Batman and Joker in
					the interrogation scene made us question the core principles
					of civilization. Are we truly more civilized and morally
					developed than other forms of life, or do we simply act
					cleverly to conceal the true nature of our survival
					instinct: eat or be eaten? When we look at our surroundings
					from a certain distance and see things according to Joker's
					perspective, once for a moment, we may think these so-called
					civilized people are only as good as the world allows them
					to be. When the chips are down, they will eat each other.
					Maybe he is not a monster, but just ahead of the curve.
					<hr />
					When Bruce Wayne made that climb without a rope, it made us
					believe in the most fundamental survival instinct of every
					living thing: the fear of death. With no rope, it was do or
					die for Bruce Wayne. That is the ultimate weapon if we want
					to cross our threshold. Fear of death does not make us weak;
					it makes us strong enough to push the boundaries beneath our
					limits.
					<hr />
					We got a reality check in the final act of Dark Knight Rises
					when Batman says to Gordon, "A hero can be anyone, even a
					man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a
					coat on a young boy's shoulders to let him know that the
					world hadn't ended." Heroes do exist in real life. They may
					not have fancy cars, nice houses, or talk smartly.
					Certainly, they can't fly or kill dozens of people with the
					snap of their finger. But when the time comes and the
					situation demands it, they won't hesitate to go any further
					to save their loved ones.
					<hr />
					We '90s kids won't forget this all-time classic trilogy from
					Nolan. For those who have experienced it in-depth, it
					becomes a part of their thinking. Seeing Heath Ledger as the
					Joker was undoubtedly one of the finest cinematic
					experiences, and I can bet on anything, there will be no
					repetition of that phenomenon. That final act of The Dark
					Knight proves that perfection does exist. But only once a
					century. It's a timeless gem for the cinema industry, and
					cinephiles across the world will always be grateful for
					that.
					<hr />
					Zack Synder's version of Batman is controversial (Batman v
					Superman). I can't blame people if they don't get connected
					with it. It was heavily dependent on comic book references.
					At first, I didn't like it either. But as I began to drive
					deep into the DC animated universe, I realized how
					enthusiastic and phenomenal Ben Affleck was. This guy did
					his best and deserves no hatred at all. His physique is
					top-notch, his fighting skills are superb, and his brutality
					knows no bounds. He is straight out of Dark Knight Returns,
					one of the best DC animated films ever made. This old
					version of Batman is a visual representation of how far he
					can go to protect what he thinks is right. Even the most
					powerful ones get scared when they feel that level of
					dedication.
					<hr />
					Batman: Under The Red Hood portrays a diabolical villain who
					knows Batman's every move. The conversation between Batman,
					Joker, and Red Hood hits us with that age-old debate that we
					have been searching for an answer to ever since we grew up.
					Will we keep doing the right work without considering the
					consequences, or should we bend ourselves to maintain the
					right outcome? He can be an outcast. But he can make the
					choice that no one else can make, the right choice. People
					will hate Batman for it, but that's the point of Batman.
