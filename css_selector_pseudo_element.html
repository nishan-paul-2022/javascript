		<h1>CSS Selector : Pseudo Element</h1>

		<p>
			JOHN IS A MAN OF FOCUS, COMMITMENT, SHEER WILL. SOMETHING YOU KNOW
			VERY LITTLE ABOUT. I ONCE SAW HIM KILL THREE MEN IN A BAR, WITH A
			PENCIL. WITH A FUCKING. PENCIL. THEN SUDDENLY ONE DAY HE ASKED TO
			LEAVE. IT'S OVER A WOMAN, OF COURSE. SO I MADE A DEAL WITH HIM. I
			GAVE HIM AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK. A JOB NO ONE COULD HAVE PULLED OFF. THE
			BODIES HE BURIED THAT DAY LAID THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT WE ARE NOW.
			AND THEN MY SON, A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS WIFE DIED, YOU STEAL HIS CAR
			AND KILL HIS FUCKING DOG.
