		<h1>CSS Selector : Pseudo Element</h1>

		<p class="container">
			John is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will. Something you know
			very little about. I once saw him kill three men in a bar, with a
			pencil. With a fucking pencil. Then suddenly one day he asked to
			leave. It's over a woman, of course. So I made a deal with him. I
			gave him an impossible task. A job no one could have pulled off. The
			bodies he buried that day laid the foundation of what we are now.
			And then my son, a few days after his wife died, you steal his car
			and kill his fucking dog.
