		<h1>CSS Property : Background 01</h1>

		<p>
			The <b>background-attachment</b> property specifies whether the
			background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the
			rest of the page).
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Tip:</strong> If we do not see any scrollbars, try to resize
			the browser window.

<!-- 
when using shorthand property, order of property values:
	# background-color
	# background-image
	# background-repeat
	# background-attachment
	# background-position

doesn't matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order
