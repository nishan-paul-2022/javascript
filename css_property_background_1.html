		<h1>The background-attachment Property</h1>

		<p>
			The background-attachment property specifies whether the background
			image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of
			the page).
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Tip:</strong> If you do not see any scrollbars, try to
			resize the browser window.

<!-- 
when using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:
    # background-color
    # background-image
    # background-repeat
    # background-attachment
    # background-position

it does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order.-->
